WHAT IS .NET?
    .NET is a free cross-platform open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications.
    .NET can be executed on all platforms which have a .NET implementation, but the most common platform is still Microsoft Windows.
    You can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build web, mobile, desktop, games,...
    Your code will run natively on any compatible operating system.
    .NET provides a standard set of base class libraries and APIs common to all .NET applications. Each app model can expose additional APIs specific to the operating system it runs on or the capabilities it provides.

WHAT IS NUGET?
    An essential tool for any modern development platform is a mechanism through which developers can create, share, and consume useful code. Often such code is bundled into "packages" that contain compiled code (as DLLs) along with other content needed in the projects that consume these packages.
    For .NET (including .NET Core), the Microsoft-supported mechanism for sharing code is NuGet, which defines how packages for .NET are created, hosted, and consumed, and provides the tools for each of those roles.
    NuGet is the package manager for .NET. 
    A NuGet package contains reusable compiled code (DLLs), other files related to that code, and a descriptive manifest.
    Developers with code to share create packages and publish them to a public or private host. Package consumers obtain those packages from suitable hosts, add them to their projects, and then call a package's functionality in their project code. NuGet itself then handles all of the intermediate details.

WHAT IS WPF?
    GUI, stands for Graphical User Interface, framework allows you to create an application with a wide range of GUI elements. Without it, you would have to manually create the elements and handle the user interactions/events.
    WPF, stands for WIndow Presentation Foundation, is a GUI framework that is used with .NET framework to create applications.
    The WPF development platform supports a broad set of application development features, including an application model, resources, controls, graphics, layout, data binding, documents, and security.
    A WPF window is a combination of a XAML (.xaml) file and a CodeBehind (.cs) file in C#/VB.NET/any other .NET language to provide a declarative model for application programming.
    I. Breaking Down a WPF App:
        1. MainWindow files:
            a) .xaml file:

                <Window x:Class="AppName.MainWindow"
                    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
                    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
                    xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
                    xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
                    xmlns:local="clr-namespace:AppName"
                    mc:Ignorable="d"
                    Title="MainWindow" Height="450" Width="800">
                    <Grid>
                        <TextBlock>Hello, World!</TextBlock>
                    </Grid>
                </Window>

                <Window></Window>:
                    this class/tag serves as the root of the Window and provodes you with the standard border, title bar, max/min, and close buttons
                x:Class:
                    this attribute tells the XAML file which class to use, which, in this case, is "MainWindow"
                Title:
                    this attribute defines the title of the window shown in the title bar
                Height and Width:
                    these attributes define the starting height and width of the window
                Icon:
                    this attribute defines the icon of the window
                ResizeMode:
                    CanResize (default) / CanMinimize / NoResize
                    this attribute controls whether and how the end-user can resize the window
                ShowInTaskbar:
                    true (default) / false
                    this attribute allows the window to be or not to be represented in the Windows taskbar
                SizeToContent:
                    Manual (default) / Width / Height / WidthAndHeight
                    this attribute decides if the window should resize itself to automatically fit its content
                Topmost:
                    false (default) / true
                    this attribute allows the window to or not to stay on top of other windows
                WindowStartupLocation:
                    Manual (default) / CenterOwner / CenterScreen
                    this attribute controls the initial position of the window
                WindowState:
                    Normal (default) / Maximized / Minimized
                    this attribute controls the initial window state
            b) .cs file:

                using System;
                using System.Windows;
                using System.Windows.Controls;

                namespace WpfApp
                {
                    /// <summary>
                    /// Interaction logic for MainWindow.xaml
                    /// </summary>
                    public partial class MainWindow : Window
                    {
                        public MainWindow()
                        {
                            InitializeComponent();
                        }
                    }
                }

                public partial class MainWindow : Window:
                    this class is definied as partial because it's being combined with the XAML file in runtime to give you the full window and is required to get a full functioning window up and running. 
                InitializeComponent():
                    this method is what gives you the full window
        2. App files:
            a) .xaml file: 
                this is the declarative starting point of your application

                <Application x:Class="WpfApp.App"
                    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
                    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
                    xmlns:local="clr-namespace:WpfApp"
                    StartupUri="MainWindow.xaml">
                    <Application.Resources>
                        
                    </Application.Resources>
                </Application>
            
                StartupUri="MainWindow.xaml":
                    this attribute instructs which Window or Page to start up when the application is launched, which, in this case, is "MainWindow.xaml"
                Startup="Application_Startup":
                    this attribute allows you to subscribe to the Startup event through XAML where you can manually create the starting window
            b) .cs file: 
                this extends the Application class, which is a central class in a WPF Windows application, and is also the place to subscribe to important application events, like the Startup event where you can manually create the starting window, unhandled exceptions,... allowing you to do stuff on the application level

                using System;
                using System.Collections.Generic;
                using System.Windows;

                namespace WpfApp
                {
                    /// <summary>
                    /// Interaction logic for App.xaml
                    /// </summary>
                    public partial class App : Application
                    {
                        private void Application_Startup(object sender, StartupEventArgs e)
                        {
                            // Create the startup window
                            MainWindow wnd = new MainWindow();
                            // Do stuff here, e.g. to the window
                            wnd.Title = "Something else";
                            // Show the window
                            wnd.Show();
                        }
                    }
                }
                
                private void Application_Startup(object sender, StartupEventArgs e):
                    adding this method allows you to manipulate the startup window before showing it
    II. Command-line Parameters:
        Command-line parameters are a technique where you can pass a set of parameters to an application that you wish to start, to influence it.
        These are passed to your WPF application through the Startup event, which you subscribed to in the App.xaml file.
    III. Resources:
        WPF has the ability to store data as a resource.
        WPF automatically goes up the the hierarchy/scope, from the local panel/control, to the local window, then to the entire global application, to find a given resource.
        1. MainWindow .xaml file:
            a) on control level:

                <Window x:Class="WpfApp.MainWindow"
                    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
                    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
                    xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
                    xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
                    xmlns:sys="clr-namespace:System;assembly=mscorlib"
                    mc:Ignorable="d"
                    Title="MainWindow" Height="450" Width="800">
                    <StackPanel>
                        <StackPanel.Resources>
                            <sys:String x:Key="strPanel">Hello, Panel world!</sys:String>
                        </StackPanel.Resources>
                        <TextBlock Text="{StaticResource strPanel}" />
                    </StackPanel>
                </Window>

            b) on window level:

                <Window x:Class="WpfApp.MainWindow"
                    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
                    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
                    xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
                    xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
                    xmlns:sys="clr-namespace:System;assembly=mscorlib"
                    mc:Ignorable="d"
                    Title="MainWindow" Height="450" Width="800">
                    <Window.Resources>
                        <sys:String x:Key="strWindow">Hello, Window world!</sys:String>
                    </Window.Resources>
                    <StackPanel>
                        <TextBlock Text="{StaticResource strWindow}" />
                    </StackPanel>
                </Window>       

        2. on application level:
            a) App .xaml file:

                <Application x:Class="WpfApp.App"
                    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
                    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
                    xmlns:sys="clr-namespace:System;assembly=mscorlib"
                    StartupUri="MainWindow.xaml">
                    <Application.Resources>
                        <sys:String x:Key="strApp">Hello, Application world!</sys:String>
                    </Application.Resources>
                </Application>

            b) MainWindow .xaml file:

                <Window x:Class="WpfApp.MainWindow"
                    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
                    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
                    xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
                    xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
                    xmlns:sys="clr-namespace:System;assembly=mscorlib"
                    mc:Ignorable="d"
                    Title="MainWindow" Height="450" Width="800">
                    <StackPanel>
                        <TextBlock Text="{StaticResource strApp}" />
                    </StackPanel>
                </Window>

        3. Code-behind App .cs file:
            (check VS)

        xmlns:sys="clr-namespace:System;assembly=mscorlib":
            this attribute is needed to use resources
        x:Key:
            this attribute specifies the key which the resources are given with
            this allows you to reference the key from other parts of the application
        StaticResource and DynamicResource:
            these markup extensions are used with the key's name to reference the resources
        StaticResource:
            this markup extension is resolved only once which is at the point where the XAML is loaded
            if the resource is then changed later on, this change will not be reflected where you have used it
        DynamicResource:
            this markup extension is resolved once it's actually needed, and then again if the resource changes
            this also allows you to use resources which are not even there during design time,... if you add it from Code-behind during the startup of the application
        FindResource():
            this method finds the specified named key and returns the resource as an object if found
    
    IV. Exception Handling:
        Whenever you have a piece of code that are likely to throw an exception, then you should wrap it in a try-catch block to handle the exception.
        Sometimes even the simplest code can throw an exception. Instead of wrapping every single line of code with a try-catch block, WPF lets you handle all unhandled exceptions globally through the "DispatcherUnhandledException" event on the Application class. If subscribed to, WPF will call the subscribing method once an exception is thrown which is not handled in your own code.
        You should handle exceptions locally when it makes sense and only use the global handling as a fallback mechanism, since local handling allows you to be more specific and deal with the problem in a more specialized way.
    V. Reusable WPF Controls:
        User controls, in WPF represented by the UserControl class, is the concept of grouping markup and code into a reusable container, so that the same interface, with the same functionality, can be used in several different places and even across several applications.
        1. UserControl:
            a) MainUserControl .xaml file:
                <UserControl x:Class="WpfApp.MainUserControl"
                    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
                    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
                    xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006" 
                    xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008" 
                    xmlns:local="clr-namespace:WpfApp"
                    mc:Ignorable="d" 
                    d:DesignHeight="450" d:DesignWidth="800">
                    <Grid>
                        <TextBlock>Hello, World!</TextBlock>
                    </Grid>
                </UserControl>

                A user control acts much like a WPF Window - an area where you can place other controls, and then a Code-behind file where you can interact with these controls.
            b) MainWindow .xaml file:

                <Window x:Class="WpfApp.MainWindow"
                    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
                    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
                    xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
                    xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
                    xmlns:local="clr-namespace:WpfApp"
                    xmlns:uc="clr-namespace:WpfApp"
                    mc:Ignorable="d"
                    Title="MainWindow" Height="450" Width="800">
                    <Grid>
                        <uc:MainUserControl />
                    </Grid>
                </Window>

                WPF will then allow you to embed this collection of functionality in one or several places in your application, allowing you to easily group and re-use functionality across your application(s).
        2. Custom Controls:
    VI. Data Binding:
        Data binding is a general technique that binds two data/information sources together and maintains synchronization of data.
        In WPF, this is the preferred way to bring data from your code to the UI layer.

WHAT IS XAML?
    XAML, stands for Extensible Application Markup Language, is a variant of XML for describing a GUI.
    File extension: .xaml
    I. Characteristics:
        case-sensitive because the control name has to correspond to a type in the .NET framework, ex, the attribute name corresponds to the properties of the control
        PascalCase
    II. Controls:
        1. TextBlock:
            This control allows you to render texts/strings, especially works well for multiline strings.
            This doesn't take "Content" but "Text" attribute.
            Relavant controls:
                Span
                Run
                LineBreak
                Border
                Bold
                Italic
                Underline
                Hyperlink
        2. Button:
            This control allows you to add buttons to your Window.
            This can not only contain simple text, but also host other controls inside of it.
            This only supports one direct child control.
        3. Label:
            This control allows you to render short one-line texts/strings, use templated content through the ContentTemplate property, and use access keys to give focus to related controls.
            This can not only contain simple text, but also host other controls inside of it.
            This only supports one direct child control.
            Relavant controls:    
                AccessText
        4. TextBox:
            This control is the most basic text-input control found in WPF, allowing the end-user to write plain text, either on a single line, for dialog input, or in multiple lines, like an editor.
            Relavant Attributes:
                TextWrapping
                AcceptsReturn
                SpellCheck.IsEnabled
                Language
                IsReadOnly
                SelectionChanged
                TabIndex
                IsTabStop
        5. CheckBox:
            This control allows the end-user to toggle an option on or off. 
            This can not only contain simple text, but also host other controls inside of it.
            This only supports one direct child control.
            This usually corresponds to a boolean value in the Code-behind, which means that it only has two states: true or false (on or off). However, since a boolean data type might be nullable, effectively allowing for a third option (true, false or null), this will get a third state called "the indeterminate state".
            Relavant Attributes:
                IsChecked
                IsThreeState
                Checked
                Unchecked
        6. RadioButton:
            This control allows you to give your user a list of possible options, with only one of them selected at the same time.
            This can not only contain simple text, but also host other controls inside of it.
            This only supports one direct child control.
            Relavant Attributes:
                IsChecked
                GroupName
        7. PasswordBox:
            This control allows you to display something else than the actual characters when typing in a password.
            Relavant Attributes:
                PasswordChar
                MaxLength
        8. ComboBox:
        9. ListBox:
        10. Image:
            This control allows you to display images inside your applications, whether from a remote source, an embedded resource, or from the local computer. 
            URI, stands for Uniform Resource Identifier, is a sequence of characters that distinguishes one resource from another.
            There are two types of URIs:
                - URN, stands for Uniform Resource Name, is a persistent and location-independent identifier that follows the “urn” scheme.
                - URL, stands for Uniform Resource Locator, is a specific type of identifier that not only identifies the resource but tells you how to access it or where it’s located.
            Relavant Attributes:
                Source
                Stretch
        11. WPF Panels:
            Panels are one of the most important control types of WPF. They act as containers for other controls and control the layout of the windows. Since a window can only contain one child control, a panel is often used to divide up the space into areas, where each area can contain a control or another panel.
            a) Grid:
                This is a very versatile panel.
                In its most basic form, this takes all of the controls you put into it, stretch them to use the maximum available space and place it on top of each other.
                However, this can contain multiple rows and columns, where you can define a height for each of the rows and a width for each of the columns.
                Relevant Controls:
                    Grid.ColumnDefinitions
                    ColumnDefinition
                    Grid.RowDefinitions
                    RowDefinition
                    GridSplitter
                Relavant Attributes:
                    Width
                    Height
                        -> if "Width" or "Height" is assigned with "*" value, the controls will share the space equally
                    Grid.Column
                    Grid.ColumnSpan
                    Grid.Row
                    Grid.RowSpan
                    HorizontalAlignment
                    VerticalAlignment
            b) WrapPanel:
                This positions each of its child controls next to the other, horizontally (default) or vertically, until there is no more room, where it will wrap to the next line and then continue.
                Relavant Attributes:
                    Orientation
            c) StackPanel:
                This is similar to "WrapPanel", but instead of wrapping the content, it stretches the content in one direction, allowing you to stack item after item on top of each other, horizontally or vertically (default). 
                Relavant Attributes:
                    Orientation
                    HorizontalAlignment
                    VerticalAlignment
            d) DockPanel:
                This docks the content in all four directions (top, bottom, left, and right). 
                How the space is divided might differ because this decides which control to favor by looking at their position in the markup (first come first serve).
                The default behavior is that the last child of this takes up the rest of the space, but this can be disabled using "LastChildFill".
                Relavant Attributes:
                    DockPanel.Dock
                    LastChildFill
    III. Attributes:
        Common Attributes:
            Content="Value" -> the content only allows one child element, in other words, all the content inside a tag has to be under one parent element
            FontSize
            FontWeight
            FontStyle
            Foreground
            Background
            TextTrimming
            TextWrapping
            TextDecorations
            TextOptions.TextFormattingMode
            TextOptions.TextRenderingMode
            Tooltip
            Margin
            Padding
            HorizontalAlignment
            VerticalAlignment
            Orientation
        To globally apply a property, either across the entire application or just the Window:

            <Window.Resources>
                <Style TargetType="{x:Type Button}">
                    <Setter Property="Padding" Value="5,2"/>
                </Style>
            </Window.Resources>

        To access other controls in a dialog by holding down the [Alt] key and then pressing a character which corresponds to the control that you wish to access:
            - define the access key by placing an underscore (_) before the character, it can be before any of the characters in the "Content", the character should not already be used as an access key for another control
            - use "Target" attribute to connect the "Label" and the designated control, the binding is based on the name of the control, so if you change this name, you will also have to remember to change the binding

            <Label Content="_Name:" Target="{Binding ElementName=txtName}" />
            <TextBox Name="txtName" />

    IV. Events:
        Common Events:
            KeyDown
            KeyUp
            MouseDown
            MouseUp
            MouseEnter
            MouseLeave
