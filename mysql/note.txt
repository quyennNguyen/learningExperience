        1. Relational Database:
        2. No-relational Database:
    
WHAT IS JDBC?
    API, stands for Application Programming Interface, is a tool that connects different software together.
    JDBC, stands for Java Database Connectivity, is a Java API that allows Java to access the DBMS.
    To add JDBC Driver to a Java application from IntelliJ:
        - File
        - Project Structure
        - Project Settings
        - Modules
        - Dependencies
        - Add JARS or Directories
        - Attach Files and Directories
        - Look for mysql-connector-j-8.0.33.jar

WHAT IS SQL AND MYSQL?
    SQL, stands for Structured Query Language, is a programming language used in DBMS. 
    SQL is not case-sensitive.
    Data types in SQL:
        - VARCHAR(length) (length is variable)
        - CHAR(length) (length is fixed)
        - INT
        - DECIMAL
    MySQL is a type of DBMS.
    To start MySQL from Ubuntu: mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -p -u root -p
    Syntax:    
        - SELECT is used to retrieve data from a table.
        - The data returned is stored in a result table called ResultSet.
        1. Database:
            SHOW DATABASES;
            CREATE DATABASE dbname_db;
            USE dbname_db;
        2. Table:
            SHOW TABLES;
            CREATE TABLE tbname( … );
            DESCRIBE tbname;
            ALTER TABLE tbname RENAME TABLE oldname TO newname;
            DROP TABLE tbname;
            SELECT * FROM tbname;
            SELECT what FROM what WHERE condition;
            SELECT multiple column separated by commas FROM what WHERE (multiple conditions separated by AND/OR);
            SELECT DISTINT what FROM what;
            SELECT what FROM what ORDER by what; (ascending order)
            SELECT what FROM what ORDER by what DESC; (descending order)
            SELECT what FROM what WHERE what IN( … );
            SELECT what FROM what WHERE what BETWEEN what AND what;
            SELECT what FROM what WHERE what LIKE ‘pattern’; (EX: ‘%A%’)
            SELECT what FROM what WHERE what LIMIT howmuch;
        3. Row:
            INSERT INTO tbname VALUES( …);
            UPDATE tbname SET what=newvalue WHERE condition;
            DELETE FROM tbname WHERE condition;
        4. Column:
            ALTER TABLE tbname ADD what type;
            ALTER TABLE tbname MODIFY what newtype;
            ALTER TABLE tbname RENAME COLUMN oldname TO newname;
            ALTER TABLE tbname DROP what;
