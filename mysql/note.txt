WHAT IS DATABASE?
    Database is a storage for a collection of data/information.
    DBMS, Database Management System, is the software that manages the database.
    There are 2 types of DBMS:
        1. Relational Database: MySQL -> tables
        2. No-relational Database: NoSQL -> documents
    JDBC, Java Database Connectivity, is a Java API that allows Java to access the DBMS.

WHAT IS SQL AND MYSQL?
    SQL, Structured Query Language, is a programming language used in DBMS. 
    SQL is not case-sensitive.
    Data types in SQL:
        - VARCHAR(length) (length is variable)
        - CHAR(length) (length is fixed)
        - INT
    MySQL is a type of DBMS.
    To start MySQL from Ubuntu: mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -p -u root -p
    Syntax:    
        - SELECT is used to retrieve data from a table.
        - The data returned is stored in a result table called ResultSet.
        1. Database:
            SHOW DATABASES;
            CREATE DATABASE dbname_db;
            USE dbname_db;
        2. Table:
            SHOW TABLES;
            CREATE TABLE tbname( … );
            DESCRIBE tbname;
            ALTER TABLE tbname RENAME TABLE oldname TO newname;
            DROP TABLE tbname;
            SELECT * FROM tbname;
            SELECT what FROM what WHERE condition;
            SELECT multiple column separated by commas FROM what WHERE (multiple conditions separated by AND/OR);
            SELECT DISTINT what FROM what;
            SELECT what FROM what ORDER by what; (ascending order)
            SELECT what FROM what ORDER by what DESC; (descending order)
            SELECT what FROM what WHERE what IN( … );
            SELECT what FROM what WHERE what BETWEEN what AND what;
            SELECT what FROM what WHERE what LIKE ‘pattern’; (EX: ‘%A%’)
            SELECT what FROM what WHERE what LIMIT howmuch;
        3. Row:
            INSERT INTO tbname VALUES( …);
            UPDATE tbname SET what=newvalue WHERE condition;
            DELETE FROM tbname WHERE condition;
        4. Column:
            ALTER TABLE tbname ADD what type;
            ALTER TABLE tbname MODIFY what newtype;
            ALTER TABLE tbname RENAME COLUMN oldname TO newname;
            ALTER TABLE tbname DROP what;
