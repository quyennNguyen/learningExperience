WHAT IS DATABASE?
    Database is a collection of data stored in format that can be accessed, managed, and updated.
    DBMS, stands for Database Management System, serves as an interface between the end-user (back-end) and the database, and allows the user to create, read, update, and delete the data in the database.
    There are 2 types of DBMS used to store, retrieve, and manage data:
        1. Relational Database (RDBMS):
            a. Data Model:
                It stores data in a relational data model that uses tables.
                It is based on a fixed schema to define the tables and their relationaships.
                Each table is made of rows and columns.
                Each row represents a single record.
                Each column represents a particular attribute of the record.
            b. Scalability:
                It is less scalable, and may require more complex scaling strategies.
            c. Consistency:
                It is highly structured and provides a strong consistency.
                Data is always in a consistent state.
            d. Querying:
                It uses SQL to query data.
            e. Application:
                It is well-suited for applications that require complex queries and support transactions such as financial or e-commerce systems.
            EX: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MicrosoftSQLServer, MariaDB,...
        2. NoSQL Database:
            a. Data Model:
                It stores data in a variety of data models including key-value pairs, documents, or graphs.
                It is not based on a fixed schema (schemaless).
            b. Scalability:
                It is highly scalable and flexible, and can handle a large amount of data and traffics.
            c. Consistency:
                It sacrifices consistency in favor of scalability and performance.
            d. Querying:
                It often uses its own query language or APIs.
            e. Application:
                It is often used for large-scale web applications such as social media platforms, where data is highly distributed and the schema may evolve rapidly.
            EX: MongoDB, Firebase, Redis, Cassandra,...
WHAT IS JDBC?
    API, stands for Application Programming Interface, is a tool that connects different software together.
    JDBC, stands for Java Database Connectivity, is a Java API that allows Java to access the DBMS.
    To add JDBC Driver to a Java application from IntelliJ:
        - File
        - Project Structure
        - Project Settings
        - Modules
        - Dependencies
        - Add JARS or Directories
        - Attach Files and Directories
        - Look for mysql-connector-j-8.0.33.jar

WHAT IS SQL AND MYSQL?
    SQL, stands for Structured Query Language, is a programming language used in DBMS. 
    SQL is not case-sensitive.
    Data types in SQL:
        - VARCHAR(length) (length is variable)
        - CHAR(length) (length is fixed)
        - INT
        - DECIMAL
    MySQL is a type of DBMS.
    To start MySQL from Ubuntu: mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -p -u root -p
    Syntax:    
        SELECT is used to retrieve data from a table.
        The data returned is stored in a result table called ResultSet.
        DAO
        DDL -> CREATE / ALTER
        DML -> SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE
        DCL -> GRANT / REVOKE
        TCL -> COMMIT / ROLLBACK
        1. Database:
            SHOW DATABASES;
            CREATE DATABASE dbname_db;
            USE dbname_db;
        2. Table:
            SHOW TABLES;
            CREATE TABLE tbname( … );
            DESCRIBE tbname;
            ALTER TABLE tbname RENAME TABLE oldname TO newname;
            DROP TABLE tbname;
            SELECT * FROM tbname;
            SELECT what FROM what WHERE condition;
            SELECT multiple column separated by commas FROM what WHERE (multiple conditions separated by AND/OR);
            SELECT DISTINT what FROM what;
            SELECT what FROM what ORDER by what; (ascending order)
            SELECT what FROM what ORDER by what DESC; (descending order)
            SELECT what FROM what WHERE what IN( … );
            SELECT what FROM what WHERE what BETWEEN what AND what;
            SELECT what FROM what WHERE what LIKE ‘pattern’; (EX: ‘%A%’)
            SELECT what FROM what WHERE what LIMIT howmuch;
        3. Row:
            INSERT INTO tbname VALUES( …);
            UPDATE tbname SET what=newvalue WHERE condition;
            DELETE FROM tbname WHERE condition;
        4. Column:
            ALTER TABLE tbname ADD what type;
            ALTER TABLE tbname MODIFY what newtype;
            ALTER TABLE tbname RENAME COLUMN oldname TO newname;
            ALTER TABLE tbname DROP what;
