WHAT IS DATABASE?
    Database is a collection of data stored in format that can be accessed, managed, and updated.
    DBMS, stands for Database Management System, serves as an interface between the end-user (back-end) and the database, and allows the user to create, read, update, and delete the data in the database.
    There are 2 types of DBMS used to store, retrieve, and manage data:
        1. Relational Database (RDBMS):
            a. Data Model:
                This stores data in a relational data model that uses tables.
                This is based on a fixed schema to define the tables and their relationaships.
                Each table is made of rows and columns.
                Each row represents a single record with unique key/id.
                Each column represents a particular attribute of the record.
            b. Scalability:
                This is less scalable, and may require more complex scaling strategies.
            c. Consistency:
                This is highly structured and provides a strong consistency.
                Data is always in a consistent state.
            d. Querying:
                This uses SQL to query data.
            e. Application:
                This is well-suited for applications that require complex queries and support transactions such as financial or e-commerce systems.
            EX: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MicrosoftSQLServer, MariaDB,...
        2. NoSQL Database:
            a. Data Model:
                This stores data in a variety of data models including key-value pairs, documents, or graphs.
                This is not based on a fixed schema (schemaless).
            b. Scalability:
                This is highly scalable and flexible, and can handle a large amount of data and traffics.
            c. Consistency:
                This sacrifices consistency in favor of scalability and performance.
            d. Querying:
                This often uses its own query language or APIs.
            e. Application:
                This is often used for large-scale web applications such as social media platforms, where data is highly distributed and the schema may evolve rapidly.
            EX: MongoDB, Firebase, Redis, Cassandra,...

WHAT IS SQL AND MYSQL?
    SQL, stands for Structured Query Language, is a programming language used to perform all types of data operations in RDBMS such as write and query data, communicate with data,... 
    SQL is not case-sensitive.
    MySQL is a type of RDMS that provides a managing user interface for operating data in a database. 
    To start MySQL from Ubuntu: mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -p -u root -p
    I. DATA TYPES:
        When creating a table in a database, each column in the table is required to have a name and a data type.
        The data types let the SQL know what type of value will be stored in the columns.
        1. Character/String:
            CHAR
            VARCHAR
            TEXT
        2. Numeric:
            BIT
            TINYINT
            SMALLINT
            INT
            BIGINT
            DECIMAL
            NUMERIC
            FLOAT
            REAL
        3. Date/Time:
            DATE
            TIME
            DATETIME
            TIMESTAMP
            YEAR
        4. Binary:
            BINARY
            VARBINARY
            IMAGE
        5. Miscellaneous:
            CLOB
            BLOB
            XML
            JSON
    II. FUNCTIONS:
        1. Data Definition Language (DDL):
            This defines and deals with database schemas and descriptions of how data should exist in the database.
            DROP
            RENAME
            CREATE
            ALTER
            TRUNCATE
        2. Data Manipulation Language (DML):
            This deals with data manipulation such as storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data in the database.
            SELECT
            INSERT
            UPDATE
            DELETE
            NOTE: SELECT is used to retrieve data from a table. The data returned is stored in a result table called ResultSet.
        3. (DCL):
            GRANT / REVOKE
        4. (TCL):
            COMMIT / ROLLBACK
        5. Aggregate Functions:
            COUNT
            MAX
            MIN
            SUM
            AVG
    III. OPERATORS:
        There are used in WHERE clause.
        = > < >= <= != <> 
        BETWEEN LIKE IN
        AND OR NOT
    IV. SQL ALIAS:
        Alias is a shorthand for a table or a column name.
        Using aliases reduces the amount of typing required to enter a query and makes complex queries easier to read.
        It is useful with JOINs and aggregate functions.
        It only exists for the duration of the query.
    III. COMMON COMMANDS:
        1. For Databases:
            SHOW DATABASES;
            CREATE DATABASE dbname_db;
            USE dbname_db;
        2. For Tables:
            SHOW TABLES;
            CREATE TABLE tbname(name datatype pairs separated by commas); 
            CREATE TABLE tbname(columnname1 DATATYPE, columnname2 DATATYPE, columnname3 DATATYPE);
            DESCRIBE tbname;
            ALTER TABLE tbname RENAME TABLE oldname TO newname;
            DROP TABLE tbname;
        3. For Records:
            SELECT specific columns separated by commas FROM tbname WHERE (multiple conditions separated by AND/OR);
            SELECT * FROM tbname;
            SELECT DISTINT what FROM tbname;
            SELECT what FROM tbname ORDER by what; (ascending order)
            SELECT what FROM tbname ORDER by what DESC; (descending order)
            SELECT what FROM tbname WHERE condition;
            SELECT what FROM tbname WHERE what IN( … );
            SELECT what FROM tbname WHERE what BETWEEN what AND what;
            SELECT what FROM tbname WHERE what LIKE ‘pattern’; (EX: ‘%A%’)
            SELECT what FROM tbname WHERE what LIMIT howmuch;
            INSERT INTO tbname VALUES(values for each column separated by commas);
            INSERT INTO tbname(specific columns separated by commas) VALUES(values for each column separated by commas);
            UPDATE tbname SET what=newvalue WHERE condition;
            DELETE FROM tbname WHERE condition;
            GROUP BY
            HAVING
        4. For Columns:
            ALTER TABLE tbname ADD what datatype;
            ALTER TABLE tbname MODIFY what newdatatype;
            ALTER TABLE tbname CHANGE oldname newname datatype;
            ALTER TABLE tbname RENAME COLUMN oldname TO newname;
            ALTER TABLE tbname DROP what;
WHAT IS JDBC?
    API, stands for Application Programming Interface, is a tool that connects different software together.
    JDBC, stands for Java Database Connectivity, is a Java API that allows Java to access the DBMS.
    To add JDBC Driver to a Java application from IntelliJ:
        - File
        - Project Structure
        - Project Settings
        - Modules
        - Dependencies
        - Add JARS or Directories
        - Attach Files and Directories
        - Look for mysql-connector-j-8.0.33.jar
