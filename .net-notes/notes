WHAT IS .NET?
    .NET is a free cross-platform open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications.
    You can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build web, mobile, desktop, games,...
    Your code will run natively on any compatible operating system.
    .NET provides a standard set of base class libraries and APIs common to all .NET applications. Each app model can expose additional APIs specific to the operating system it runs on or the capabilities it provides.

WHAT IS NUGET?
    An essential tool for any modern development platform is a mechanism through which developers can create, share, and consume useful code. Often such code is bundled into "packages" that contain compiled code (as DLLs) along with other content needed in the projects that consume these packages.
    For .NET (including .NET Core), the Microsoft-supported mechanism for sharing code is NuGet, which defines how packages for .NET are created, hosted, and consumed, and provides the tools for each of those roles.
    NuGet is the package manager for .NET. 
    A NuGet package contains reusable compiled code (DLLs), other files related to that code, and a descriptive manifest.
    Developers with code to share create packages and publish them to a public or private host. Package consumers obtain those packages from suitable hosts, add them to their projects, and then call a package's functionality in their project code. NuGet itself then handles all of the intermediate details.

WHAT IS WPF?
    WPF, stands for WIndow Presentation Foundation, is a GUI framework that is used with .NET framework to create applications.
    GUI, stands for Graphical User Interface, framework allows you to create an application with a wide range of GUI elements. Without it, you would have to manually create the elements and handle the user interactions/events.
    WPF is a combination of XAML, stands for Extensible Application Markup Language, and C#/VB.NET/any other .NET language to provide a declarative model for application programming.
    The WPF development platform supports a broad set of application development features, including an application model, resources, controls, graphics, layout, data binding, documents, and security.

    The basic "Hello World" WPF app:
        <Window x:Class="WpfApp.MainWindow"
            xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
            xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
            xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
            xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
            xmlns:local="clr-namespace:WpfApp"
            mc:Ignorable="d"
            Title="MainWindow" Height="450" Width="800">
            <Grid>
                <TextBlock HorizontalAlignment="Center" VerticalAlignment="Center" FontSize="72">Hello, World!</TextBlock>
            </Grid>
        </Window>
