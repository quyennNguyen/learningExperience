HOW TO SET UP MYSQL?

WHAT ARE MYSQL DATA TYPES?
    When creating a table in a database, each column in the table is required to have a name and a data type.
    The data types let the SQL know what type of value will be stored in the columns.
    1. Character/String:
        CHAR
        VARCHAR
        TEXT
    2. Numeric:
        BIT
        TINYINT
        SMALLINT
        INT
        BIGINT
        DECIMAL
        NUMERIC
        FLOAT
        REAL
    3. Date/Time:
        DATE
        TIME
        DATETIME
        TIMESTAMP
        YEAR
    4. Binary:
        BINARY
        VARBINARY
        IMAGE
    5. Miscellaneous:
        CLOB
        BLOB
        XML
        JSON

WHAT ARE MYSQL OPERATORS?
    = > < >= <= != <> 
    BETWEEN LIKE IN
    AND OR NOT

WHAT ARE MYSQL FUNCTIONS?
    1. Data Definition Language (DDL):
        This defines and deals with database schemas and descriptions of how data should exist in the database.
        DROP
        RENAME
        CREATE
        ALTER
        TRUNCATE
    2. Data Manipulation Language (DML):
        This deals with data manipulation such as storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data in the database.
        SELECT
        INSERT
        UPDATE
        DELETE
        NOTE: SELECT is used to retrieve data from a table. The data returned is stored in a result table called ResultSet.
    3. (DCL):
        GRANT / REVOKE
    4. (TCL):
        COMMIT / ROLLBACK
    5. Aggregate Functions:
        COUNT
        MAX
        MIN
        SUM
        AVG

WHAT ARE TYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DIFFERENT DATA FIELDS?
    @OneToOne
    @OneToMany
    @ManyToOne
    unique
    required
    optional
    
WHAT ARE SQL ALIAS?
    Alias is a shorthand for a table or a column name.
    Using aliases reduces the amount of typing required to enter a query and makes complex queries easier to read.
    It is useful with JOINs and aggregate functions.
    It only exists for the duration of the query.

SUM UP COMMON MYSQL COMMANDS:
    1. For Databases:
        SHOW DATABASES;
        CREATE DATABASE dbname_db;
        USE dbname_db;
    2. For Tables:
        SHOW TABLES;
        CREATE TABLE tbname(name datatype pairs separated by commas); 
        CREATE TABLE tbname(columnname1 DATATYPE, columnname2 DATATYPE, columnname3 DATATYPE);
        DESCRIBE tbname;
        ALTER TABLE tbname RENAME TABLE oldname TO newname;
        DROP TABLE tbname;
    3. For Records:
        SELECT specific columns separated by commas FROM tbname WHERE (multiple conditions separated by AND/OR);
        SELECT * FROM tbname;
        SELECT DISTINT what FROM tbname;
        SELECT what FROM tbname ORDER by what; (ascending order)
        SELECT what FROM tbname ORDER by what DESC; (descending order)
        SELECT what FROM tbname WHERE condition;
        SELECT what FROM tbname WHERE what IN( … );
        SELECT what FROM tbname WHERE what BETWEEN what AND what;
        SELECT what FROM tbname WHERE what LIKE ‘pattern’; (EX: ‘%A%’)
        SELECT what FROM tbname WHERE what LIMIT howmuch;
        INSERT INTO tbname VALUES(values for each column separated by commas);
        INSERT INTO tbname(specific columns separated by commas) VALUES(values for each column separated by commas);
        UPDATE tbname SET what=newvalue WHERE condition;
        DELETE FROM tbname WHERE condition;
        GROUP BY
        HAVING
    4. For Columns:
        ALTER TABLE tbname ADD what datatype;
        ALTER TABLE tbname MODIFY what newdatatype;
        ALTER TABLE tbname CHANGE oldname newname datatype;
        ALTER TABLE tbname RENAME COLUMN oldname TO newname;
        ALTER TABLE tbname DROP what;
