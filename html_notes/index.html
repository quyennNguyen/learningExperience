<!--WHAT IS HTML?
    HTML, stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, is the standard markup language/the most basic building block for creating the Web.
    HTML defines the meaning and structure of the Web content. In the mean time (SIDE NOTE), CSS describes the Web appearance/presentation, and JavaScript defines the Web functionality/behavior.
    HYPERTEXT refers to links, the fundamental aspect of the Web, that connect Web pages to one another, either winthin a single website or between websites.
    MARKUP LANGUAGE is a computer language that annotates the Web content for display in the Web browser by using special elements. -->

<!--WHAT IS HTML ELEMENTS?
    HTML elements are defined by <STARTING TAG> CONTENT </CLOSING TAG>.
    SIDE NOTE: the word "element" and "tag" are usually used/called interchangably.
    They tell the Web browser how to display the Web content.
    They can have attributes, which provide additional information about the elements.
    They are case insensitive.
    They don't require quotes, but should use single quotes or double quotes to prevent errors.
    Empty elements don't have a content and closing tag and might have attributes.
    Block-level elements are included with extra spaces/lines/breaks around them.
    In-line-level elements are not included with spaces around them. -->
