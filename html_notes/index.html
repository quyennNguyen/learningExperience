<!--WHAT IS HTML?
    HTML, stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, is the standard markup language/the most basic building block for creating the Web.
    HTML defines the meaning and structure of the Web content. In the mean time (SIDE NOTE), CSS describes the Web appearance/presentation, and JavaScript defines the Web functionality/behavior.
    HYPERTEXT refers to links, the fundamental aspect of the Web, that connect Web pages to one another, either winthin a single website (link resources of the same Web pages) or between websites.
    MARKUP LANGUAGE is a computer language that annotates the Web content for display in the Web browser by using special elements. -->

<!--WHAT IS HTML ELEMENTS?
    HTML elements are defined by <STARTING TAG> CONTENT </CLOSING TAG>.
    SIDE NOTE: the word "element" and "tag" are usually used/called interchangably.
    They tell the Web browser how to display the Web content.
    They can have attributes, which provide additional information about the elements.
    They are case insensitive.
    They don't require quotes, but should use single quotes or double quotes to prevent errors.
    Empty elements don't have a content and closing tag and might have attributes.
    Block-level elements are included with extra spaces/lines/breaks around them.
    In-line-level elements are not included with spaces around them. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--This tag declares the document type of the Web page.
    !DOCTYPE represents HTML5 -->

<html lang="en-US">
<!--This tag defines the root element of an HTML page, where everything goes between.
    Two main sections between this tag are <head> and <body>.
    The "lang" attribute specifies the language code (or country code/dialect) of the Web page.
        lang="en-US" - the first two characters specify the language code and the last two characters specify the country code -->

<head>
    <!--This tag contains the data which is not on the Web page but is considered metadata of an HTML page. -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!--This tag defines the metadata of the HTML page and specifies the character set, page description, keywords, document's author, viewpoint settings,...
        The "charset" attribute specifies the character encoding of the Web page.
        The "name" attribute specifies a name for the metadata.
        The "content" attribute specifies the value associated with the http-equiv or name attribute. -->
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
    <!--This tag specifies the title of the Web page, which is visible in the Web browser's title bar or the Web page's tab. -->
    <link rel="icon" href="img/html5.png" type="image/x-icon">
    <!--This tag specifies the relationship between the Web page and an external resource, which usually links to external style sheets or adds a favicon to the Web page.
        The "rel" attribute specifies the relationship between the current content and the linked content.
        The "href" attribute, in this case, is a relative reference.
        The "type" attribute specifies the media type of the linked content. -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css" type="text/css">
</head>

<body>
    <!--This tag contains all the visible Web contents. -->

    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <p>Summer is coming up. I can't wait to throw a vacation.</p>
    <!--This tag sepcifies the paragraph of the Web page.
        SIDE NOTE: space collapsing happens when no matter how many lines or whitespaces you space between <p> tag, they won't be represented on the Web page.

    <hr>
    <!--This tag specifies the thematic break in the Web page, which is usually displayed as a horizontal rule to seperate contents. -->

            The "href" attribute specifies the link's destination.
            The "target" atribute specifies where the link should be opened.
            SIDE NOTE:
                There are three types of reference, which is used in "href" or "src" attribute:
                    1. The absolute reference is the full address of an external source hosted on a different Web server that the link leads to.
                    2. The relative reference is the address of the local source within the same Web server of the Web page that you are hosting.
                    3. The internal reference is the address to a source within the same Web page. -->

        <!--This tag embeds an image in the Web page.
        The "src" attribute specifies the path to the image.
        The "alt" attribute specifies the alternate text for the image, which can be read by the screen reader if the image cannot be displayed.
        The "width" and "height" attributes of an image is highly recommended to be specified or else the image might flicker whenever loading.
        The "loading" attribute specifies whether the Web browser should load the image immediately, which is "eager" (default value), or defer the loading until some conditions are met, which is "lazy".
        SIDE NOTE: the Web page will load faster with "lazy" than with "eager" because it doesn't have to wait until all the images are loaded to completely load the whole page. -->
