# ABOUT ME

#### I started by attending community college with major in Computer Science, where I learned the basics, a bit of Java, and a bit of Data Structure. Later on, I transferred to university to continue my major. But not long after that, I decided to do the boldest thing Iâ€™ve ever done in my life, DROPPING OUT. Of course, there were a lot of conflicts. But I genuinely think that school is not for me. Two main reasons: it is tedious and it ends up with an overwhelming debt.
#### In this journal, I want to be crystal clear and note down how I learn to become a SELF-TAUGHT WEB DEVELOPER from SCRATCH. I found this way fascinating and productive as I can keep track of my growth and get over my procrastination.
