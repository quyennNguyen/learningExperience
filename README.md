long story short

Like many other kids, I started by attending community college with major in Computer Science, where I learned the basics, a bit of Java, and a bit of Data Structure. Later on, I transferred to university to continue my major, but not long after that, I decided to do the boldest thing I’ve ever done in my life, DROPPING OUT. Of course, there were a lot of conflicts. But I genuinely think that school is not for me. Two main reasons: it is tedious and ends up with massive debt on your head. Therefore, I am absolutely determined to become a SELF-TAUGHT SOFTWARE DEVELOPER.

I’m as clueless as I’ve ever been.
Every day is a new lesson.
But that will never be the reason I give up.
Therefore, in this journal, I want to be crystal clear and note down how I learn to become a SELF-TAUGHT SOFTWARE DEVELOPER from SCRATCH, from A to Z, from 0 to infinite.
I found this way fascinating and productive as I can keep track of my growth, reduce my severe procrastination, and hopefully can help whoever has the same feeling/situation as me.
