WHAT IS AN API?
    API, stands for Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules, protocols, and conventions that define how software components interact with each other.
    It provides a standardized way for different software components or systems to communicate and exchange data, to work together seamlessly.
    
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LIBRARY AND A FRAMEWORK?
  Both libraries and framworks are reusable code written by someone else that are used to support your programs to develope complex applications.
  Being declarative means I can tell the computer WHAT to do and the computer can handle the details, while being imperative means I have to tell the computer HOW to do WHAT steps by steps. Libraries and framworks are usually declarative.
  Their difference lies in the concept of IoC (Inversion of Control).
  When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You control when and where to call the library.
  When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow of the application. It provides places for you to plug in your code, and it calls your code as needed.
