WHAT IS JSON?
    JSON, stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data interchange format for storing and transporting data, which is often used when data is sent from a Web server to a Web page. 
    JSON is language independent, which means the code for reading and generating JSON can be written in any programming language, and self-describing, which means JSON format is text only.
    JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects because JSON format is deprived from JavaScript object notation syntax. Therefore, a JavaScript program easily converts JSON data to native JavaScript objects.
    Syntax:
        1. JSON data is written in name:value pairs.
            { "fieldName":"value" }
        2. JSON data is separated by commas.
        3. JSON objects are written in curly braces {}.
        4. JSON arrays are written in square brackets [].
