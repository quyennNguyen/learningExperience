/*WHAT IS CSS?
    CSS, stands for Cascading Style Sheet, is a standard language used to give styling and design to websites.
    While HTML forms the structural foundation of a Web page, CSS describes its presentation (colors, backgrounds, font sizes, layouts,...).
    HTML and CSS usually go hand-in-hand.
*/
/*WHATS ARE CSS SELECTORS AND PROPERTIES?
    CSS rule consists of a selector and a style declaration block and is defined by:
        SELECTOR {
            PROPERTY: VALUE;
        }
    Selectors select the HTML elements that you want to style.
    Style declaration block contains one or more style declarations, each of which consists of a property and a value, where you style the selected element.
    CSS SELECTORS:
        I. Universal Selector:
        This selector selects and applies the style declaration to all elements on the Web page.
        Syntax: * {
                    property: value;
                }
        II. Simple Selectors:
            1. Element Selector:
            By selecting the tag name of an element, the style declaration is applied to all elements with that tag name on the Web page.
            Syntax: tag-name {
                        property: value;
                    }
            2. Class Selector:
            By selecting a certain class name (with a "class" attribute), the style declaration is applied to only elements with that particular class name on the Web page.
            This selector can be used multiple times.
            Prefix: "." period
            Syntax: .class-name {
                        property: value;
                    }
            3. ID Selector:
            By selecting a certain ID name (with an "id" attribute), the style declaration is applied to only elements with that particular id name on the Web page.
            It is possible to use this selector more than once, but the convention says the id shoulld be unique for selected element.
            Prefix: "#" hash
            Syntax: #id-name {
                        property: value;
                    }
        III. Pseudo Selectors:
        These selectors are used commonly in interactivity with the Web page.
            1. Pseudo-Element Selector:
            A pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector to style specified part(s) of the selected element.
            Full list: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements
            Operator: "::" double colon
            Syntax: selector::pseudo-element {
                        property: value;
                    }
            2. Pseudo-Class Selector:
            A pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector to style a specified special state of the selected element.
            Full list: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes
            Operator: ":" single colon
            Syntax: selector:pseudo-class {
                        property: value;
                    }
        IV. Attribute Selector:
        This selector selects and applies the style declaration to all elements...
            1. with a specified attribute:
            Syntax: selector[attribute] {
                        property: value;
                    }
            2. with a specified attribute whose value is exactly the specified "value":
            Syntax: selector[attribute="value"] {
                        property: value;
                    }
            3. with a specified attribute whose value is exactly the specified "value" or the specified "value" followed by "-":
            Operator: "|" pipe
            Syntax: selector[attribute|="value"] {
                        property: value;
                    }
            4. with a specified attribute whose value contains a specified space-separated whole-word "value":
            Operator: "~" tilde
            Syntax: selector[attribute~="value"] {
                        property: value;
                    }
            5. with a specified attribute whose value contains a specified "value", which is unnecessarily space-separated whole-word:
            Operator: "*" asterisk
            Syntax: selector[attribute*="value"] {
                        property: value;
                    }
            6. with a specified attribute whose value starts with a specified "value", which is unnecessarily space-separated whole-word:
            Operator: "^" caret
            Syntax: selector[attribute^="value"] {
                        property: value;
                    }
            7. with a specified attribute whose value ends with a specified "value", which is unnecessarily space-separated whole-word:
            Operator: "$" dollar 
            Syntax: selector[attribute$="value"] {
                        property: value;
                    }           
        SIDE NOTE:
                    add "i" or "I" before "]" for case-insensitivity
                    add "s" or "S" before "]" for case-sensitivity
        V. Advanced Selectors:
        More than one selector can be grouped together.
        A combinator is included to define the relationship between the selectors.
            1. Adjacent Sibling Selector:
            This selector selects and applies the style declaration to an element that immediately follows another specified element.
            Conditions: (1) the second element immediately follows the first element and (2) both elements are children of the same parent element.
            Combinator: "+" plus
            Syntax: selector1 + selector2 {
                        property: value;
                    }
            2. General Sibling Selector:
            This selector selects and applies the style declaration to all elements that follow a specified element.
            Conditions: (1) the second element(s) (not necessarily immediately) follows the first element and (2) both elements are children of the same parent element.
            Combinator: "~" tilde
            Syntax: selector1 ~ selector2 {
                        property: value;
                    }
            3. Child Selector:
            This selector selects and applies the style declaration to all elements that are immediate/direct children of a specified element.
            Combinator: ">" greater than
            Syntax: selector1 > selector2 {
                        property: value;
                    }
            4. Descendant Selector:
            This selector selects and applies the style declaration to all elements that are descendants (not immediate/direct children) of a specified element.
            Syntax: selector1 selector2 {
                        property: value;
                    }
    CSS SPECIFICITY:
        If there are two or more CSS rules that point at the same element, the CSS selector with the highest specificity value will override the others, and its style declaration will be applied to that element.
        CSS Specificity Hierarchy: 
            Universal Selector (+0)
            Element Selector/Pseudo-Element Selector (+1)
            Class Selector/Pseudo-Class Selector/Attribute Selectors (+10)
            ID Selector (+100)
            Inline Style/Contextual Style (+1000)
        SIDE NOTE:
                    Inline Style/Contextual Style means instead of having CSS rules written
                        1. in a seperate CSS file
                        2. in the <style> tag in the <head> tag of the HTML document
                        Syntax: <head>
                                    <style>
                                        CSS rules
                                    </style>
                                </head>
                    for the styling of the HTML document, you can apply the CSS rules directly into the HTML tag by using the "style" attribute.
                    Syntax: <start-tag style="CSS rule"> content </end-tag>
    CSS PROPERTIES:
        Shorthand Properties are properties that can set values of multiples other properties simultaneously in one whitespace-seperated style declaration, which usually have a specific order for the values, to obtain more concise code.
        There are some special values built in every properties:
            1. initial: to set the property to its default value
            2. inherit: to inherit the property from its parent element
*/
/*WHAT ARE CSS UNITS?
    Length is a number followed by a length unit, EX: 100px.
    One length can be specified in various units.
    There are two types of length units:
        1. Absolute Units:
        These units are fixed, and the length expressed in these units appears exactly as that size.
        EX: cm, mm, in, px, pc, pt, Q,...
        2. Relative Units:
        These units specify a length which scales relative to another length property.
        EX: %, em, ex, ch, rem, lh, vw, vh, vmin, vmax,...
    SIDE NOTE:
                In computing, DPI, which stands for Dots Per Inch, is a measure of the number of dots that can be placed within a span of an inch, or the dot density, of digital printing/scanning devices, such as printer,... 
                Similarly, PPI, which stands for Pixels Per Inch, is a measure of the pixel density of electronic image devices, such as television display, computer monitor, video, image,...
                Either DPI or PPI can be used to describe the resolution of an output device. The higher the DPI or PPI, the higher the resolution, the sharper the output.
                EX: The qualtity setting of a Youtube video can range from 144p, 240p, 360p, 480p, to 720p (HD), 1080p (FHD), 1440p (2K), 2160p (4K). These numbers specify the vertical resolution pixels of the video display (this is not the PPI but the number of pixels the display height has). As you set the higher quality, the video display appears smoother and clearer.
                So, pixel is an absolute unit but relatively scale based on what output device you're on.
                EX: The qualtity of a Youtube video is set at 2160p (4K), which means the video display has a resolution of 3840p (width) x 2160p (height), which is a fixed unit. However, the sharpness of the display might differ between when you set the display at full screen and when you set the display at theater mode. The resolution relatively scales based on the size of the display.

*/
/*WHAT IS CSS COLOR?
    Three primary colors of light sources (at least determined by computer system) are Red - Green - Blue.
    One CSS color can be specified in various ways:
        1. predefined name
        2. hex:
        Syntax: #rrggbb
        Each parameter (rr, gg, bb) specifies the intensity of red, green, and blue, respectively, by hexadecimal values from 00 to ff.
        3. rgb:
        Syntax: rgb(rrr, ggg, bbb)
        Each parameter (rrr, ggg, and bbb) specifies the intensity of red, green, and blue, respectively, which ranges from 0 to 255.
        4. hsl:
        Syntax: hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
        "hue" specifies the degree on the color wheel, which ranges from 0 to 360, where red is 0, green is 120, blue is 240.
        "saturation" specifies a percentage of the color intensity, where 0% is a shade of gray, 100% is the pure color.
        "lightness" specifies a percentage of the color lightness, where 0% is black, 50% is the pure color, 100% is white.
        5. rgba & hsla:
        Syntax:
                rgba(rrr, ggg, bbb, aa)
                hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)
        "rgba" and "hsla" are extensions of "rgb" and "hsl" color values with an alpha channel.
        "alpha" specifies the opacity/transparency of the color, which ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 is fully transparent, 1.0 is fully opaque.
*/
/*WHAT ARE CSS GRADIENT?
    1. linear-gradient(direction/angle, color1, color2,...)
    There should be at least 2 color stops.
    "direction" can be to top, to bottom (default value), to left, to right, to top left, to top right, to bottom left, to bottom right.
    "angle" ranges from 0deg to 360deg, where to top is 0deg, to right is 90deg, to bottom is 180deg (default value), to left is 270deg.
    SIDE NOTE:
                add "repeating-" before the property to repeat the gradients
                add a percentage after the color stop to adjust the proportion of the color
    2. radial-gradient(shape size at position, color1, color2,...)
    There should be at least 2 color stops.
    "shape" can be ellipse (default value), or circle.
    "size" can be closest-side, farthest-side, closest-corner, farthest-corner (default value).
    "position" as in CSS background-position
    SIDE NOTE:
                add "repeating-" before the property to repeat the gradients
                add a percentage after the color stop to adjust the proportion of the color
    3. conic-gradient(from angle at position, color1, color2,...)
    There should be at least 2 color stops.
    By default, "angle" is 0deg, "position" is center (50% 50%).
    SIDE NOTE:
                add "repeating-" before the property to repeat the gradients
                add an angle after the color stop to adjust the proportion of the color
                add property "border-radius: 50%" to make the conic gradients as a pie
*/
/*WHAT IS CSS BACKGROUND?
    "background" is a shorthand property.

*/
/*WHAT IS CSS FONT?
    "font" is a shorthand property.
    Order:
        1. font-style (optional):
        Value:
                normal
                italic
                oblique
        2. font-variant (optional):
        Value:
                normal
                small-caps
        3. font-weight (optional):
        Value can be specified in:
            a. predefined values:
            normal, lighter, bold, bolder
            b. length:
            x (without unit)
            "x" ranges from 100 to 900
        4. font-size (required):
        Value can be specified in:
            a. predefined values:
            xx-small, x-small, small, smaller, medium, large, larger, x-large, xx-large
            b. absolute size:
            This sets the text to a specified fixed size.
            This does not allow user to change the text size in the Web browser, which is not good for accessibility reasons.
            This is only useful when the physical size of the output is known.
            c. relative size:
            This sets the text to a relative size based on the surrounding elements.
            This allows user to change the text size in the Web browser.
        By default, the font size is 1em = 16px.
        SIDE NOTE:
                    "em" indicates the font size of the element and is a relative unit, where x em means x times the size of the current font.
                    Setting font size with "em" or "px" allows user to adjust the text size or resize the Web page by zoom tool.
        SIDE NOTE: 
                    In some older Web browsers, there is a problem where the text becomes larger or smaller than it should when adjusted.
                    To solve that problem, set a default font-size in percentage in the "body"
                        body {
                            font-size: 100%;
                        }
                    This allows the text to be shown the same in all Web browsers as well as allows all Web browsers to zoom or resize the text.
        5. font-family (required):
        There are five generic font families: serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive, fantasy.
        Each font family is a collection of different font names with similar features.
        Value:
                font-name-1, font-name-2,..., font-family
        Web Safe Fonts are fonts that are universally installed across all browsers.
        Some commonly used are:
            Arial (sans-serif)
            Verdana (sans-serif)
            Helvetica (sans-serif)
            Tahoma (sans-serif)
            Trebuchet MS (sans-serif)
            Times New Roman (serif)
            Georgia (serif)
            Garamond (serif)
            Courier New (monospace)
            Brush Script MT (cursive)
        Fallback Fonts are fonts that are similar to the first declared font in the same font family and added as backup fonts. If the first declared one is not found or not installed properly, the Web browser will try the following one, and the one after, and so on. It is highly suggested to declare more than one font and end the list with the generic font family name.

/*WHAT IS CSS FLOAT AND CLEAR?
    1. float:
    Value:
            left
            right
            none (default value)
    2. clear:
    Value:
            left
            right
            both
            none (default value)
    SIDE NOTE:
                If the floated element is taller than the containing element and overflows out of its container, add either
                    1. the clearfix hack:
                    Syntax:
                            selector {
                                "overflow: auto";
                            }
                    2. the new modern clearfix hack:
                    Syntax:
                            selector::after {
                                content: "";
                                clear: both;
                                display: table;
                            }
                When creating floating boxes side by side, if something is added to enlarge the width of each boxes, the big box might break, then add this property to include the padding and border to the total width of the boxes and make sure the big box doesn't break
                    Syntax:
                            * {
                                box-sizing: border-box;
                            }
*/
/*WHAT IS CSS DISPLAY?
    Value:
            block
            inline
            none (default value)
    SIDE NOTE:
                There is a similarity between "display: none" and "visibility: hidden". Both of which hide the element. But with "display: none", the hidden element doesn't take up the space and behaves as if it's not there. And with "visibility: hidden", the hidden element still takes up the space and affects the layout.

/*WHAT IS THE BOX MODEL IN CSS DESIGN, POSITIONING, AND LAYOUT?
    CSS Box Model is a series of positioning properties designed to layout HTML elements. Think of it like an invisible box that wraps around every HTML element and is layered like an onion. Different layers are sized by using different properties.
    From outer to inner, there are:
        I. MARGIN (outer transparent space)
        The margin layer can be sized by using the "margin" property.
        Value can be specified in:
            a. predefined values:
            auto
            b. length:
            x+unit of choice (EX: px, %, vw,...)
        SIDE NOTE:
                    Sometimes there can be a collapse of two margins between one's top and one's bottom, whose larger portion will take over.
        II. BORDER
        The border layer can be sized by using the "border" property.
        This is a shorthand property.
        Order:
            1. border-width (optional):
            Value can be specified in:
                a. predefined values:
                thin, medium, thick
                b. length:
                x+unit of choice (EX: px, %, vw,...)
            2. border-style (required):
            Value:
                    dotted
                    dashed
                    solid
                    double
                    groove
                    ridge
                    inset
                    outset
                    hidden
                    none
            3. border-color (optional):
            Value as in CSS colors
            4. border-radius (not in shorthand property order):
            Value can be specified by length:
                                                x+unit of choice (EX: px, %, vw,...)
        III. PADDING (innner transparent space)
        The padding layer can be sized by using the "padding" property.
        Value can be specified by length:
                                            x+unit of choice (EX: px, %, vw,...)
        IV. CONTENT
        The content layer can be sized by using the "width" and "height" properties.
        Value can be specified in:
            a. predefined values:
            auto (default value)
            b. length:
            x+unit of choice (EX: px, %, vw,...)
        SIDE NOTE:
                    Some suggested content properties for a better responsive Web page are "max-width", "min-width", "max-height", "min-height".
    SIDE NOTE:
                It is possible to layout individual sides of each layer:
                    1. by using the property of the specified side:
                    EX:
                        margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, or margin-left
                        border-top, border-right, border-bottom, or border-left
                        padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, or padding-left
                    2. by using the shorthand property:
                    If the property has four values, the layout will be sized as:
                        selector {
                            property: top right bottom left
                        }
                    If the property has three values, the layout will be sized as:
                        selector {
                            property: top right&left bottom
                        }
                    If the property has two values, the layout will be sized as:
                        selector {
                            property: top&bottom right&left
                        }
                    If the property has one value, the layout will be sized as:
                        selector {
                            property: all sizes equal
                        }
                To keep the size of the Web page consistent among different devices, it is suggested to use px, %, or vw.
