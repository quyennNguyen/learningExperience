WHAT IS HIBERNATE?
  When using Hibernate, there are 3 rules to follow:
    1. Keyword @Entity
    2. Unique IDs:
      There are 4 ways to create IDs:
        AUTO: allows database to vendor your IDs
        IDENTITY: increments the IDs
        SEQUENCE: you have to type what type of sequence you want to use (this is good for PostgreSQL)
        TABLE: this will create a separate table for your IDs aside the table of your entity
    3. Default constructor
